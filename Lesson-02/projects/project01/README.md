# Project 1 - Just the Basics

Create a SAM application that consists of an API Gateway REST API that proxies all requests to a single Lambda function.
This function should return the following json response `{"hello": "world"}`

We'll start with an AWS Cloud9 AL2 environment.

The Serverless Application Model CLI should already be installed and configured by default.
We can check this by running `sam --version` in the terminal.
If you get an error, yell at Timir Karia.

Because the tech industry can't standardize on if a CLI should create a new folder in the current directory and initialize the new project in that folder or if the CLI should initialize the new project in the current directory, we're going to YOLO it and jsut run the `init` command from the root of our environment.

        SAM CLI now collects telemetry to better understand customer needs.

        You can OPT OUT and disable telemetry collection by setting the
        environment variable SAM_CLI_TELEMETRY=0 in your shell.
        Thanks for your help!

Which template source would you like to use?
        1 - AWS Quick Start Templates
        2 - Custom Template Location
```

Pick option 1.
If the options have changed, yell at Jacob Fuss.

```text
What package type would you like to use?
        1 - Zip (artifact is a zip uploaded to S3)
        2 - Image (artifact is an image uploaded to an ECR image repository)
Package type: 
```

As before, pick option 1 to indicate that we will be packaging our Lambda function via ZIP instead of the new Docker Image format. 
This is a great time to point out that SAM treats Lambda functions as the center of literally every serverless project.
Are you creating an event-driven application that doesn't need functions and instead uses API Gateway and EventBridge?
Too bad, you need to answer this very specific implentation question about Lambda functions before you can proceed on your quest.

```text
Which runtime would you like to use?
        1 - nodejs14.x
        2 - python3.8
        3 - ruby2.7
        4 - go1.x
        5 - java11
        6 - dotnetcore3.1
        7 - nodejs12.x
        8 - nodejs10.x
        9 - python3.7
        10 - python3.6
        11 - python2.7
        12 - ruby2.5
        13 - java8.al2
        14 - java8
        15 - dotnetcore2.1
Runtime: 
```

Find Rust on the list and pick that number.
Just kidding, Lambda only provides managed runtimes for LTS languages, we've got 4 versions of Python and 3 versions each of nodeJS and Java, but Rust and .NET 5 developers don't deserve to be loved.
We'll pick `9` for `python3.7` and we'll fix it later.

```text
Project name [sam-app]: ðŸ—‘ðŸ”¥
```

I'm going to name the project `ðŸ—‘ðŸ”¥`, you can name yours whatever you want.

```text
AWS quick start application templates:
        1 - Hello World Example
        2 - EventBridge Hello World
        3 - EventBridge App from scratch (100+ Event Schemas)
        4 - Step Functions Sample App (Stock Trader)
Template selection: 
```

Pick `1` for `Hello World Example`, we'll cover the other options in a later lesson.

```text

    Next steps can be found in the README file at ./ðŸ—‘ðŸ”¥/README.md
        

SAM CLI update available (1.23.0); (1.19.0 installed)
To download: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html
```

Cool, now the SAM CLI has scaffolded an example serverless application in a folder named ðŸ—‘ðŸ”¥.

let's deploy our new application.

```bash
cd ðŸ—‘ðŸ”¥
sam deploy --guided
```

The SAM CLI will prompt you for deployment options, we will walk through each of these in turn.

Configuring SAM deploy
======================

        Looking for config file [samconfig.toml] :  Not found

        Setting default arguments for 'sam deploy'
        =========================================
        Stack Name [sam-app]: U1F5D1-U1F525
        AWS Region [us-west-2]: 
        #Shows you resources changes to be deployed and require a 'Y' to initiate deploy
        Confirm changes before deploy [y/N]: N
        #SAM needs permission to be able to create roles to connect to the resources in your template
        Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation [Y/n]: Y
        HelloWorldFunction may not have authorization defined, Is this okay? [y/N]: y
        Save arguments to configuration file [Y/n]: Y
        SAM configuration file [samconfig.toml]: 
        SAM configuration environment [default]: 

        Looking for resources needed for deployment: Not found.
        Creating the required resources...
        Successfully created!

                Managed S3 bucket: aws-sam-cli-managed-default-samclisourcebucket-1i0sbjhna2lzd
                A different default S3 bucket can be set in samconfig.toml

        Saved arguments to config file
        Running 'sam deploy' for future deployments will use the parameters saved above.
        The above parameters can be changed by modifying samconfig.toml

```
The Options presented are as follows:

```text
Stack Name [sam-app]: U1F5D1-U1F525
```

AWS Cloudformation is a bit more strict than the SAM CLI, so we need to come up with an alphanumeric name for the stack name. (//TODO Describe what a stack is).
I'm going to name mine `U1F5D1-U1F525`, you can name yours whatever you would like.
The default `sam-app` is also an appropriate response.
The general pattern for these prompts is that an answer by itself in `[]` is the default option.
If multiple options are presented together, the capitalized option is the default (such as `[y/N]` where `N` or `No` is the default)

```text
AWS Region [us-west-2]: us-west-2
```

In an ideal world, this will be the region where your Cloud9 environment is deployed,
You can change it to another region if you would like to learn a very painful lesson in "why does the console only show a single region at a time?" this early in your cloud journey.
Again, the default should be fine.

```text
Confirm changes before deploy [y/N]: N
```

This is asking you if you want to be asked to deploy your infrastructure.
Anyone who replies with a `Y` is a cop.

```text
 Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation [Y/n]: Y
 ```
 
Even a very simple 'hello, world' Lambda function needs AWS IAM permissions to operate, this prompt is asking you if you're cool with IAM Roles being created for you.
There are cases where this is important, what we are doing today is not one of those so we'll accept thedefault and YOLO the role creation.

```text
HelloWorldFunction may not have authorization defined, Is this okay? [y/N]: y
```

We'll cover what `HelloWorldFunction` is in just a moment.
I *think* this prompt is referring to authorization to invoke the function?
If we accept the default, the deployment won't work, so let's pick `y` and figure out what that means later.

```text
Save arguments to configuration file [Y/n]: Y
```

As we fill out this personality test of a questionaire to deploy our appication, we can tell the SAM CLIto save our responses so we don't have to play 20-questions for every iteration of our code. The defaultwill save us a bunch of time.

```text
SAM configuration file [samconfig.toml]: samconfig.toml
```

Since we told the CLI that it's cool to save our configuration, it will now need to know where exactlyto save that configuration.
If you've noticed the pattern, you know what I'm about to say.
The default is fine for this option.

```text
SAM configuration environment [default]: 
```

This option allows you to specify several deployment targets, such as deployment pipeline stages.
Since we're not building a CI/CD system or creating multiple deployment targets today, the default is a fine choice.

Now you're going to see a whole bunch of text fly past you.
Treat this like a wood chipper, ignore it until it stops moving.

> Note: If there are odd discrepencies in the timestamps or randomly generated file names, you can safely ignore them. It's usually because I wrote this guide in several sittings and I'm not too worried about those details just yet.

Now that the CLI has calmed down, examine the final section named `Outputs`.
In my repsonse it shows a key/value pair with a key named `HelloWorldApi` with a value of `https://t4yqgjv9y6.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/hello/`.
Yours *WILL* be different.
If yours is the same, please yell at Alan Tan.
This is the url for the API we just delpoyed.
I know youre probably clammoring to do something cool so we'll poke this API a bit, then we'll dive into explaining what happened.

You can invoke the API with `cUrl`:

```bash
curl https://t4yqgjv9y6.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/hello
```

```text
Feder08:~/environment/ðŸ—‘ðŸ”¥ $ curl https://t4yqgjv9y6.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/hello/
{"message": "hello world"}Feder08:~/environment/ðŸ—‘ðŸ”¥ $ 
```

Whitespace is very hard, but we see that the API returned a JSON object `{"message": "hello world"}`.
This is very close to what the project statement asks for, but it's not quite right.
let's also check other paths by replacing the `/hello/` path with `/goodbye`

```bash
curl https://t4yqgjv9y6.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/goodbye
```

```text
Feder08:~/environment/ðŸ—‘ðŸ”¥ $ curl https://t4yqgjv9y6.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/goodbye/
{"message":"Missing Authentication Token"}Feder08:~/environment/ðŸ—‘ðŸ”¥ $
```

This is confusing because it's a JSON response with a `"message"` entry, but this one didn't come from our Lambda function.
This is the error you will receive if you try to make a request to an API Gateway REST API path that isn't defined.
Our project statement wants us to catch any possible path and route it to the same Lambda function.
So, we have two tasks ahead of us:

- adjust the response to return `{"hello": "world"}`
- change the API configuration to accept any possible path
- (off by one errors are already showing up) convert the Lambda function to Rust instead of Python3.7

We'll start with the conversion to Rust

## Adding Rust

Inside the ðŸ—‘ðŸ”¥ directory we have the follwoing files/folders

```
ðŸ—‘ðŸ”¥
â”‚   __init__.py
â”‚   README.md
â”‚   samconfig.toml
â”‚   template.yaml
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€events
â”‚   |   event.json
â”‚   
â””â”€â”€â”€hello_world
â”‚   |   __init__.py
â”‚   |   app.py
â”‚   |   requiremetns.txt
â”‚   
â””â”€â”€â”€tests
    â”‚   __init__.py
    â”‚
    â””â”€â”€â”€unit
        â”‚   __init__.py
        â”‚   test_harness.py

```

Delete the following Python related files/folders:

```bash
rm __init__.py
rm -rf ./hello_world
rm -rf ./tests
```

Now we've broken the application, fixing it is left as an exercise for the reader.
